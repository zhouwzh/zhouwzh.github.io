I'm current a master's student in New York University(expect to graduate in May, 2026). I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/).

🚧Ongoing Porjects: I'm conducting first-author research at [Agentic Learning AI Lab](https://agenticlearning.ai/) at the NYU Center for Data Science, supervised by [Prof. Mengye Ren](https://mengyeren.com/), metored by [Yanlai Yang]([https://google.com](https://yanlai00.github.io/)). Focusing on integrating contrastive learning with compositional learning(object-centric leanring to be specific).

My research interest lies in building interpretable machine intelligence and multimodal systems that can adapt to natural environments.

In addtition, I have worked on projects related to Contrastive Learning, Vision Language Model, Compositional Learning, 3D Hand-Object interaction, and 3D dataset pipeline.
